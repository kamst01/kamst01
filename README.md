### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Keifer Amster or @kamst01
I've been working with Front-End Web Development/Design for over six years now. Four years ago I was able to turn my favorite hobby into a full-time career; and now I am living the dream! Still excited, still determined & always learning. A few notes about me:
- Always interested in Front-End Web Development and its ever-changing list of technologies.
- In my current role at Outdoor Networks, I am working with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [PHP](https://php.net), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) & more. 
- Constantly looking at the possibilties, how I can improve and build upon my strengths.
